  You need to have mongodb installed, if you don't, go here
[http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart](MongoDB QuickStart Guide)

  If you're already running MongoDB on localhost on the default port, you're done.
But if you need to configure your database connection info goto the file:

```shell
vim config/database.js
```
