Welcome to SpaceMagic
=====================

  SpaceMagic is a full-stack javascript web development framework which allows
you to build fast, real-time web applications.  SpaceMagic allows you to write only
one app and share it between the client and the server.

Installation
============

```
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
npm install spacemagic
space-magic init my_project
```

Configure
---------

  You need to have mongodb installed, if you don't, go here
[http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart](MongoDB QuickStart Guide)

  If you're already running MongoDB on localhost on the default port, you're done.
But if you need to configure your database connection info goto the file:

```
vim config/database.js

```
