Build A Todo App
================

We're going to go through the steps to build a Todo App with up and downvotes.

You can see a demo of the finished product here: [Todo Example]()

We'll assume you have mongodb, node, and npm installed already and have mongo
running on the default port on localhost.

First we need to get SpaceMagic installed, so we just run:

```
npm install -g spacemagic
```

w00t, that's it, now we'll initialize a new SpaceMagic app.

```
spacemagic init todo-app
cd todo-app
npm install
```

This will create a barebones spacemagic application, and install all of the npm
modules we need to get our app up and running.

If you go to localhost:3000 you should see the welcome to spacemagic screen.
If the thing is green that means bootstrap is up and running.
